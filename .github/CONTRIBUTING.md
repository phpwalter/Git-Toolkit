## 📜 Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  
We enforce it to ensure a respectful and inclusive community for all contributors.

---

## 🧭 Where to Start

We use GitHub issues to manage work and discussion. To get started:

1. Browse the [issue tracker](https://github.com/phpwalter/Git-Toolkit/issues)
2. Look for issues labeled **`good first issue`** or **`help wanted`**
3. Comment to express interest and ask for clarification if needed
4. Fork the repo and create your own feature branch

>Before contributing, please read the [Project Charter](../CHARTER.md) to understand the vision and scope of Git Toolkit

---

## 📌 General Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Prefer small, focused changes over large, sprawling ones
- Add/update tests when introducing new functionality
- Respect our CI/CD and hook workflows
- Sync frequently with `main` or `dev` (as specified)

---

## 🔨 Development Process

We follow a PR-based model:

1. Fork → Branch → Work locally
2. Follow `.flake8`, formatting, and script standards
3. Run tests before pushing
4. Submit a PR to `main` or `dev` (depending on the issue)
5. A maintainer will review, provide feedback, and help merge

---

## 📥 Pull Requests

PRs must:

- Pass CI (GitHub Actions)
- Include relevant tests or docs
- Not break existing YAML config patterns
- Be atomic (1 purpose per PR)

Pro Tip: Reference issues like `Closes #42` in your PR description.

---

## 🐞 Issues & Feature Requests

We appreciate clear and detailed reports.

Please include:

- ✅ What happened
- ✅ Expected vs. actual behavior
- ✅ Steps to reproduce (or a failing config/command)
- ✅ Environment info (OS, Python version)

Feature requests should describe **why** the feature matters, not just what it does.

---

## ⚙️ Script Style & Standards

- Python 3.7+ with `black`, `flake8`, and `isort`
- YAML is checked using `yamllint`
- Hook logic must not break when run inside submodules
- Use `pathlib`, no hardcoded OS paths
- Use SPDX license headers where applicable

---

## 📝 Documentation Standards

We use:

- Markdown for user-facing docs (`docs/en`, `docs/es`, etc.)
- Code comments and docstrings (PEP257)
- Filename format: lowercase, kebab-case, no spaces
- Link internal references using relative paths

---

## 🔁 Sync, Integration & Tooling

- CI runs on all PRs: `ci.yml`, `release.yml`
- Releases use `semantic-release` with changelog automation
- Coverage tracked via Codecov
- Run `./scripts/check` locally to lint before pushing
- Toolkit must remain scriptable from submodule context

---

## 📄 Licensing

All contributions must comply with the **MIT License**.

> By submitting a contribution, you agree that it will be licensed under the [MIT License](../LICENSE).  
> Files must include the appropriate license header (see `LICENSE_HEADER.txt` if available).

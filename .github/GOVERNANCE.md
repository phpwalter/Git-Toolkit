# Governance

This governance model outlines how decisions are made, roles are defined, and responsibilities are assigned in our project. It balances clarity with flexibility to scale as our community grows.

---

## 1. Principles

We strive for:

- **Openness & Transparency**: All discussions and decisions are public and documented.  
- **Meritocracy**: Contributions earn trust and roles, not credentials.  
- **Fairness & Inclusivity**: Roles and decisions reflect community diversity.  
- **Sustainability**: Governance adapts over time to project needs.

## 2. Roles & Leadership

### ü§ù Contributors
Anyone who submits issues, PRs, documentation, or supports the community.

### üë• Maintainers
Contributors who have demonstrated sustained, quality work over time, empowered to merge PRs, label issues, and enforce processes.

- Selection: A contributor becomes eligible after ‚â•‚ÄØ3 merged PRs and consistent positive engagement.
- Maintainers nominate and approve new Maintainers by consensus.

### üõ°Ô∏è Steering Council (optional, for large teams)
A group of trusted Maintainers (typically 3‚Äì7) responsible for strategic decisions.

- Members serve staggered 1-year terms.
- They guide project scope, major releases, and community health.

### üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Chair
One Steering Council member appointed annually to lead meetings and break ties if consensus stalls.

## 3. Decision Making

### ‚òÆÔ∏è Consensus-seeking
Default approach: discuss major proposals in issues/discussions, aim for consensus.

### üó≥Ô∏è Voting fallback
If consensus cannot be reached within 7 days, Steering Council calls a vote:

- üó≥Ô∏è Simple majority wins.
- If tied, Chair casts deciding vote.

### üß© Minor changes
Routine maintenance‚Äîbug fixes, docs, minor refactors‚Äîcan be merged by any Maintainer if CI checks pass.

---

## 4. Onboarding & Role Advancement

- **Contributor ‚Üí Maintainer**: After ‚â•‚ÄØ3 merged PRs over 3 months and positive review feedback.
- **Maintainer ‚Üí Council**: Self-nomination or peer-nomination; confirmed by ‚Öî Council vote.
- **Chair selection**: Among Council via simple majority vote.

All transitions, demotions, or removals are communicated openly via GitHub.

## 6. Conflict Resolution

## 📜 Guiding Principles

- The project is built on **openness, collaboration, and kindness**.
- Contributors are encouraged to **share ideas early**, ask questions, and assume positive intent.
- We strive for **consensus first**, but escalate when needed.
- Governance is a **living process**, adaptable to the project's size and maturity.

>For our mission, scope, and long-term vision, see the [CHARTER.md](../CHARTER.md).

| **Maintainer**  | Active contributor with write access, reviewing PRs, triaging issues, and shaping direction. |

## 🗳️ Decision-Making Process

We use a **consensus-seeking model**:

1. Default to discussion in issues or GitHub Discussions
2. Label proposals with `#governance`, `#decision-needed`, or `#rfc`
3. Use 👍 reactions and comments to gauge alignment
4. If consensus isn’t clear, escalate to maintainers
5. Maintainers may call a majority vote on contentious proposals

All decisions are documented with links to the relevant issues or PRs.

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution

1. **Talk First**: Try direct communication with the other party
2. **Escalate**: If unresolved, tag a maintainer or open a confidential thread
3. **Moderation**: Maintainers act based on the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
4. **Appeals**: Escalate to owners or a future Steering Council

---

## 🛠️ Steering Council (Optional)

If the project grows significantly, a small rotating council (e.g. 3–5 people) may be established to:

- Oversee direction, major refactors, or breaking changes
- Help resolve disagreements between maintainers
- Act as a tie-breaker or escalation path

> The council will operate transparently, with all decisions recorded via public issues or announcements.

---

## ✏️ Amendments

Governance may be changed via:

- A PR with a detailed rationale
- Review and approval by at least 2 maintainers (or full vote, if contested)
- Version updates listed in changelog and governance section
